## Reviewing Health Data

### Glucose Monitoring

**What to look for:**
- Fasting glucose trends (target typically 70-100 mg/dL)
- Post-meal spikes (2-hour target typically <140 mg/dL)
- Patterns related to meals or activities
- Consistency of testing times

**Red flags:**
- Fasting >126 mg/dL consistently
- Post-meal >200 mg/dL
- Any reading <70 mg/dL (hypoglycemia)
- Large unexplained variations

### Blood Pressure Review

**Categories:**
- Normal: <120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg
- High Stage 1: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- High Stage 2: ≥140/≥90 mmHg

**What to monitor:**
- Trends over time
- Consistency of readings
- Time of day patterns
- Correlation with reported symptoms

### Weight & Body Composition

**Tracking guidance:**
- Weekly trends more meaningful than daily
- 1-2 lb weekly loss is sustainable
- Watch for rapid changes (>3 lbs/week)
- Consider waist circumference along with weight
